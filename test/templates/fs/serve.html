You can serve a file by opening it and using .Resp.ServeContent.

You can still set headers that are added to the response.
{{.Resp.AddHeader "Content-Type" "text/customcontenttype; charset=utf-8"}}

{{$file := .FS.Open "foo.txt"}}
{{$stat := $file.Stat}}
{{.Resp.ServeContent $stat.Name $stat.ModTime $file}}

Opened files are automatically closed when the request completes.
